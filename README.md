## 👋 Hello there!

I'm **Marco Maffei**, a full-stack developer with 9+ years of experience, currently based in **Brussels, Belgium** 🇧🇪. I enjoy crafting digital products that are not just functional, but reliable, secure, and a joy to use.

### 👨‍💻 What I’ve Been Up To

For the past 4.5 years, I’ve been working as an external full-stack developer at **Isabel Group**, Belgium’s leading fintech firm. I’ve been the *solo* full-stack dev in the marketing team, collaborating with a webmaster, DevOps, and SecOps folks to build and maintain **19+ web applications** in the company’s marketing ecosystem.

Apart form that, I have an extensive experience in different hosts and clouds with the following tech stacks:

- **PHP (Laravel)**, **Node.js** and **Python** for the back-end
- **React**, **Vue**, **Next.js**, **Nuxt.js**, and old-school templating engines for the front-end
- A mix of **WordPress**, **Drupal**, **Django**, custom CMS, and **Jamstack** solutions that talk to low-code REST APIs

Different CRMs, and other managing tools for my daily duties: Monday.com, Jira, Git, Github, Gitlab and so on.

### 🤝 How I Work

I'm big on clean code, transparent collaboration, and building things that last. Whether it's integrating third-party APIs, managing cloud deployments, or fiddling with microcopy—I’m in. Unfortunately here, most of my repos are private 😛.

### 🚀 Let's Connect

If you're building something meaningful and need someone who loves crossing the front-end/back-end divide, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to chatting about cool ideas, tech, or code philosophy.

Thanks for stopping by!

— Marco ✌️
